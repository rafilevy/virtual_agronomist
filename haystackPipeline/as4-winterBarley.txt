Three-spray programmes are recommended for winter barley due to its response to T3 fungicides and the rise in severity of late season ramularia. As such T1 and T2 can be applied slightly earlier if required to better match up with PGR timings.

The main fungicide used for winter barley disease control is Prothioconazole; however growers should look to protect this active by including alternative modes of action.

For winter barley, timing for T1 (GS30-31) is important due to more GAI on lower than on upper leaves. The slightly earlier timing will allow better pairing with an early growth regulator and reduce the need for a T0 treatment.

For winter barley, T1 (GS30-31) application options are:
Siltra Xpro 0.4 -0.6 l/ha
Cebara 1.0 -1.5 l/ha + Proline 0.25 l/ha,
Comet 0.4 l/ha + Proline 0.3-0.4 l/ha
Fandango 0.75 -1.0 l/ha
Elatus Era 0.6 -0.8 l/ha
Cyprodinil (in Cebara) will have useful activity against eyespot and mildew, also net blotch in which resistance to azoles and SDHIs is increasing.

For winter barley, an earlier timing for the T2 (GS37-39) will make inclusion of ethephon-based PGRs easier.

For winter barley, the justification for high doses at T2 (GS37-39) is difficult to prove as cost effective, the inclusion of a third spray further decreases the need for higher doses of product, in NIAB TAG trials; however brown rust susceptibility and early T2 applications may require higher doses.

For winter barley, T2 (GS43-39) application options are:
Siltra Xpro 0.4 -0.6 l/ha
Cebara + Proline 0.75 -1.0 l/ha + 0.33 l/ha
Comet + Proline 0.3 l/ha + 0.3 -0.4 l/ha
Fandango 0.75 -1.0 l/ha
Priaxor 0.75-1.0 l/ha
Elatus Era 0.4 -0.6 l/ha
In all cases add chlorothalonil (CTL) 500 g/ha.

For winter barley, only minimal input is needed for T3 (GS49-59) applications (to top up earlier treatments and provide a vehicle for a second CTL application). Application options are:
Proline 0.25 l/ha
Bumper 0.25 l/ha
Fandango 0.5 l/ha (Only two strobilurin applications permitted per crop)
Priaxor 0.75 l/ha (Only two strobilurin applications permitted per crop)
In all cases add chlorothalonil (500 g/ha).

The only reliable control option for ramularia in winter barley is chlorothalonil (CTL).

There has been considerable debate as to whether winter barley needs treating for ramularia at T1: it is unlikely to be controllable at this early timing but in a traditional two-spray programme, with the second treatment applied at GS49 (first awns), there is likely to be a benefit to treating earlier than this.

A three-spray programme for winter barley allows chlorothalonil (CTL) to be used with the latter two sprays, (so no requirement at T1) but if employing a two-spray programme (or three-sprays at T0, T1 and T2) then it would be wise to include chlorothalonil (CTL) at T1.

For winter barley, in high disease pressure seasons (mild wet early spring) T0 sprays have been necessary. Although earlier timings in a T1/T2/T3 programme should remove the need for separate T0 treatment.

Although a three-spray programme is suggested for winter barley, a traditional two-spray approach will still give effective disease control but please note: T0 fungicides are more likely to be needed chlorothalonil (CTL) should be included at T1 if the second treatment is not applied until GS49. In all cases add a morpholine to the T0 if mildew is actively developing or if rusts are present requiring rapid knockdown (e.g. Corbel 0.3 l/ha).

T3: 2018 was a very low disease year but still large responses to fungicide use. Responses to T3 treatment have been higher in the north for some time but responses are still high generally.

Eradicant fungicide activity continues to slip as more resistant Septoria isolates develop, so our control programmes are focussed on preventative disease control. Protectant activity remains good but requires well-timed applications. We also need careful fungicide stewardship to try to prevent further selection of more resistant isolates. Fortunately there has also been a shift to wheat varieties with better disease resistance, which will help reduce disease pressure and slow the development of resistance. 

Every year has different levels of disease pressure, often with different diseases being prominent. In 2014/15 there was moderate disease pressure from both Septoria tritici and yellow rust, whereas 2015/16 had very variable septoria and yellow rust levels across the country. 2016/17 had lower Septoria pressure due to a dry winter and very dry spring but yellow rust pressure was higher as was that from brown rust later in the season. 2017/18 had mainly low disease pressure in a season with a long, open autumn; a cold, wet winter; a short late, wet spring and a long, dry, very hot summer. 

Crops have been sown over a wide range of sowing dates this autumn and this has resulted in differing levels of disease in the crops at this stage. In the September sowings it is easy to find Septoria, yellow and brown rust and mildew present and active. Later sowing dates should result in less disease pressure but the mild and wet December will allow some disease build up in these crops. 

The factors considered in the disease pressure scores are: variety, sowing date, geographical location, the weather, sprayer capacity and attitude to risk.

Later sowing of winter wheat has a profound influence on disease pressure. 

Geographic location has an effect on disease pressure for winter wheat, for example lower input septoria treatments would be more appropriate for the east compared to the west/south west under almost any circumstances. 

Generally it is the weather condition after a spray that dictates the level of subsequent input required, but warm wet weather prior to treatment will build disease pressure. 

Sprayer capacity has an effect on disease pressure as it indicates the ability to spray promptly and minimise the chance of an interruption due to weather. If a farm has the capacity to spray all their wheat crops in a shorter period then it may not need as robust a programme as one that requires several days to cover all the wheat area. 

Growers’ attitude to risk is important in assessing disease pressure. However, our recent studies on the economics of wheat disease control have shown that there is a three times greater penalty to margin for spending too little when disease pressure turns out to be high than the same overall spend when disease pressure is lower; so members may wish to be cautious. 

The earlier a crop is sown the greater the disease infection it will be exposed to and the larger the amount of inoculum plants will be carrying into the spring. Autumn 2018 did allow later sowings but many farms started earlier and there is a visible difference in the level of disease in crops sown at different times with the later crops carrying much less disease.

There is a three times greater penalty to margin for spending too little when disease pressure turns out to be high than the same overall spend when disease pressure is lower; so members may wish to be cautious.
