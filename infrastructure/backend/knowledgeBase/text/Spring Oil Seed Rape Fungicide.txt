All crops of spring linseed should receive routine fungicide treatment during flowering. In seed crops this will help to safeguard seed quality, in other crops it would be an insurance against late infection sufficiently severe to have a negative impact on yield. 

In many trials, yield responses in oilseeds reflect weather conditions at flowering; in dry years no benefit from fungicide treatments was seen for spring linseed, whilst in wetter years tebuconazole applied late flowering/pod set gave good responses and would be one of the more cost-effective options.

Responses to fungicides in winter linseed have been fairly consistent. Applied at pod set, yield responses of 0.4-0.6 t/ha have been achieved. A routine spray at this timing would be beneficial. Approved fungicides: tebuconazole (some products). Approved under EAMUs: Juventus/Sunorg Pro, Filan, Proline 275, some prochloraz products.

Spring oilseed rape requires no fungicides. In NIAB TAG trials over several years spring oilseed rape has not responded to fungicides. 

Occasionally disease has been found in trials of spring oilseed rape but any yield response to fungicide application has not been cost-effective. 

In the years of severe sclerotinia in the winter crop of oilseed rape this disease was later seen in the spring crop, so if the pressure from this disease is high for the winter crop, there should be time to decide whether a treatment is warranted on the spring oilseed rape crop. If in doubt the cost can be held by using products such as Topsin/Taurus (thiophanate-methyl) or tebuconazole.
