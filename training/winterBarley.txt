Three-spray programmes are recommended for winter barley due to its response to T3 fungicides and the rise in severity of late season ramularia. As such T1 and T2 can be applied slightly earlier if required to better match up with PGR timings.

The main fungicide used for winter barley disease control is Prothioconazole; however growers should look to protect this active by including alternative modes of action.

For winter barley, timing for T1 (GS30-31) is important due to more GAI on lower than on upper leaves. The slightly earlier timing will allow better pairing with an early growth regulator and reduce the need for a T0 treatment.

For winter barley, T1 (GS30-31) application options are:
Siltra Xpro 0.4 -0.6 l/ha 
Cebara 1.0 -1.5 l/ha + Proline 0.25 l/ha,
Comet 0.4 l/ha + Proline 0.3-0.4 l/ha
Fandango 0.75 -1.0 l/ha
Elatus Era 0.6 -0.8 l/ha
Cyprodinil (in Cebara) will have useful activity against eyespot and mildew, also net blotch in which resistance to azoles and SDHIs is increasing.

For winter barley, an earlier timing for the T2 (GS37-39) will make inclusion of ethephon-based PGRs easier.

For winter barley, the justification for high doses at T2 (GS37-39) is difficult to prove as cost effective, the inclusion of a third spray further decreases the need for higher doses of product, in NIAB TAG trials; however brown rust susceptibility and early T2 applications may require higher doses.

For winter barley, T2 (GS43-39) application options are:
Siltra Xpro 0.4 -0.6 l/ha
Cebara + Proline 0.75 -1.0 l/ha + 0.33 l/ha
Comet + Proline 0.3 l/ha + 0.3 -0.4 l/ha
Fandango 0.75 -1.0 l/ha
Priaxor 0.75-1.0 l/ha
Elatus Era 0.4 -0.6 l/ha
In all cases add chlorothalonil (CTL) 500 g/ha.

For winter barley, only minimal input is needed for T3 (GS49-59) applications (to top up earlier treatments and provide a vehicle for a second CTL application). Application options are:
Proline 0.25 l/ha 
Bumper 0.25 l/ha 
Fandango 0.5 l/ha (Only two strobilurin applications permitted per crop) 
Priaxor 0.75 l/ha (Only two strobilurin applications permitted per crop) 
In all cases add chlorothalonil (500 g/ha).

The only reliable control option for ramularia in winter barley is chlorothalonil (CTL).

There has been considerable debate as to whether winter barley needs treating for ramularia at T1: it is unlikely to be controllable at this early timing but in a traditional two-spray programme, with the second treatment applied at GS49 (first awns), there is likely to be a benefit to treating earlier than this.

A three-spray programme for winter barley allows chlorothalonil (CTL) to be used with the latter two sprays, (so no requirement at T1) but if employing a two-spray programme (or three-sprays at T0, T1 and T2) then it would be wise to include chlorothalonil (CTL) at T1.

For winter barley, in high disease pressure seasons (mild wet early spring) T0 sprays have been necessary. Although earlier timings in a T1/T2/T3 programme should remove the need for separate T0 treatment. 

Although a three-spray programme is suggested for winter barley, a traditional two-spray approach will still give effective disease control but please note: T0 fungicides are more likely to be needed chlorothalonil (CTL) should be included at T1 if the second treatment is not applied until GS49. In all cases add a morpholine to the T0 if mildew is actively developing or if rusts are present requiring rapid knockdown (e.g. Corbel 0.3 l/ha).

T3: 2018 was a very low disease year but still large responses to fungicide use. Responses to T3 treatment have been higher in the north for some time but responses are still high generally.
